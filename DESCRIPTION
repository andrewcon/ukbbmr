Description: This package was made to prepare large data
             for statistical analyses. It is aimed more specifically
             at the UK Biobank dataset. However, most of the functions
             can be used freely in other data. data.table was used to 
             change values by reference and pbmapply was used for 
             multi-core application of functions. Finally, this allows
             a one-sample Mendelian Randomization to be performed on the
             final data. This requires additional files, such as dosage data.
